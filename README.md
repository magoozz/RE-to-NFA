# RE-to-NFA
Converting a Regular Expression to an NFA

## About
By taking in a string of symbols (a, b, *, (, ), |) that represents a regular expression, input strings can be supplied to see whether or not they are  contained within the language of the regular expression. Doing so by converting the regular expression into a Nondeterministic Finite Automata, then using the functionality of that class, checking to see if the strings are accepted or not.
